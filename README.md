# connection-lost-app-for-the-rpg
This is a helper tool for the two-player roleplaying game Connection Lost by Tobie Abad. A web app made using ink and javascript, with a basic UI for now.

Connection Lost is one of the games in You & I: Roleplaying Games for Two. The rulebook can be purchased at: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255136/You--I-Roleplaying-Games-for-Two. 
Most of the text are directly drawn from the rulebook. Although with my app, you could play Connection Lost without the rulebook, I hope you could still buy the rulebook to support the author.


Features include: 
All the rules you need to run a game session, designed in an interative way
A random number generator for the starting questions, sparks, and prompts
A timer of one hour, with the option to start or reset at any time


Maybe I'll implement next:
A music player for the "credit" music
A space-themed UI
